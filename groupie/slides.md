## My problem

* The curse of Spotify
* I live in a pretty small country
* Other countries are where it's at

Note:
* Obscure music taste


## Solution

* Find all of bands events in a region
* Hook into airbnb.com and skyscanner.com
* Recommended flights/accommodation

* Turn it into a real holiday opportunity
