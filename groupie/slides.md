## My problem

* The curse of Spotify
* I live in a pretty small country
* Other countries are where it's at

Note:
* Obscure music taste


## Solution

* Find all of bands events in a region
* Hook into airbnb.com and skyscanner.com
* Recommended flights/accommodation


## APIs and other resources

* http://developer.ticketmaster.com/
* http://airbnbapi.org/
* http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm


## [Demo time](http://groupie.nicro.land)



## The future

* Ticketmaster are working on an International Discovery API
* Sort accomodation/flights results by price
* Confirmation page with an estimate for the flight and event
* Hook into other APIs to find fun things to do at the destination

Note:
* Current limitation of API is market segmentation
* Select suggested flights/accom
* Turn it into a real holiday opportunity
